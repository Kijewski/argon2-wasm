Stand-alone WebAssembly implementation of [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2), tailored for my specific needs.

* Version: Argon2d v1.3
* Time cost: 4 iterations
* Memory cost: 64 MiB
* Parallelism: 1 thread
* Hash output length: 32 bytes

The cost was chosen to run for less than five seconds in a somewhat older smart-phone.
